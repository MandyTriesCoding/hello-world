# hello-world
Brand new to coding and hoping to find a new career in it someday. I have a long way to go so wish me luck! I currently work as a receptionist and social media manager in a tattoo shop. I live with a wonderful fiancee and we have three cats! It's a full house but it's a happy one. 
I probably shouldn't be doing this at work but it's a slow day so here we are!
